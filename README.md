# CS340 Project 2

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

-----I like to try and follow industry standards as far as commenting and making everything readable. Also, I feel that simplicity is key when designing and piece of software. You don't need a program to be overly complicated if it doesn't need to be that complicated. If you keep it as simple as possible, it makes for adding and adapting much easier in the future.





How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-----I try and have a level-headed approach to any project that I look to tackle. I try and create a plan for what I need to complete and prioritze items based off of importance to the project. I feel like I approached this project similarly to others that I have completed. The only other strategies I could have implemented would have been better time management with outside impact. In the end, I was able to complete.









What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

-----Computer Scientists answer and solve complex problems. This type of work would show that I can apply learning from a real-world scenario allowing transition from student to professional that much easier, and allowing me to contribute right away.
